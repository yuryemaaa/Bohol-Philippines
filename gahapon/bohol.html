      Just as other significant islands in the Philippines, Bohol also holds one of the most colorful history and historical landmarks to date. This island province was actually established through Act 2711 on March 10, 1917. During the Spanish regime, there were two significant revolts in the island. One was the Tamblot Uprising in 1621 led by a native priest. The other was the Dagohoy Rebellion where it was led by Francisco Dagohoy from 1744 to 1829. It was also at this time that Bohol was still part of the main land of Cebu and together was called a residencia. It was only in July of 1854 that it became a separate politico-military province. The Americans, led by Major Henry Hale also invaded the one of the cities in the province of Bohol on 1900 while the Japanese occupied the province for several long years during the World War II. The American forces liberated Bohol on April 11, 1954.

	Another significant happening in the history of the province was when it had the name of “Bohol”. This name is derived from the word Bool, the place where a treaty of friendship between two people of different races occurred. This was between Datu Sikatuna, a native chieftain and Miguel Lopez de Legaspi, representing the King of Spain. The treaty is popularly known as the blood compact or the “Sandugo”. This event has been commemorated with the making of the statue depicting the “Sandugo” of the two parties.

    <h2><mark>GEOGRAPHY</mark></h2>
    <p> Bohol is in the central part of the Philippines. It is about 700 kilometers south of Manila and about 70 kilometers southeast of Cebu. The island must have been developed from the magnetic tectonic mechanism which resulted from the under thrusting of the southwest Philippine plate east of Samar and Surigao. The oldest known rock formation in the island, the Alicia schist, is inferred to be a part of the Bohol crystal rocks before plate interactions. All succeeding igneous extrusive rocks to accumulate were marine and terrestrial deposits in the Bohol basin.

      It is a first class province, composed of 47 municipalities and the city of Tagbilaran, which is the capital of the province. There are 1,109 barangays populated by 1,136, 268 people (2000 count) spead over the three congressional districts of the province with an average household size of 5.4 Bohol’s primary assets are its people with the distinctive quality traits of hospitality, religiosity and strong family ties.

           Bohol’s mainland and the surrounding 73 smaller islands make up a total land area of 411,726 hectares. It is oval-shaped akin to its aromatic root crop, ‘ubi kinampay,’ which is one of the high value crops of the province. It has a gently rolling terrain, where the hilly interior is home to rare and endangered flora and fauna. The uplands are fit for agro-forestry and high value agricultural production, making it essentially an agricultural province. Its main products are rice, coconut, corn livestock and cottage industries of furniture, basketry, shell craft and home decors. Mineral resources such as limestone, manganese. silica and rock phosphate abound in the island.

The population in the productive ages (15 to 64 years) represented 58 percent of the total population while the proportion of those aged 65 years and over was about 6 percent.

Females dominated higher levels of education accounting for 52% of population (NSO 2000). Children and the youth comprise 36% of Bohol’s total population.
